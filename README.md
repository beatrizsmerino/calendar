# GULP

This project uses the `GULP task runner`.

In the [gulpfile.js](https://github.com/beatrizsmerino/calendar/blob/master/gulpfile.js) of this proyect you can see the **gulp tasks** developed to compile and compress the `SASS` and `JS`, copy and paste the `HTML` files and create a server and listen to the changes made to reload it ([Browsersync + Gulp.js](https://browsersync.io/docs/gulp))

So the project is developed in the `src` folder and published in the `dist` folder.

3. Watch the changes to the files in the `sass`, and `js` folders inside the `src` folder.
4. Create a server and reloads if there are any changes in those files of `dist` folder.

```
gulp
```

3. Export the `scripts.min.js` file to `dist/js` folder.

```
gulp js
```

## ðŸ”Ž Watch changes

This command is able to:

1. Create the server.
2. Watch the changes to the files in the `html`, `sass` and `js` folders inside the `src` folder and run the tasks to re-generate the files inside the `dist` folder.
